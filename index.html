                    Having a tough time making your 4-year plan for Rice when you don't even know when courses are offered? You're not alone.<br />
                    Some courses are offered only in the Fall or Spring, some every other year, and some just dropped off the face of the Earth.<br />
                    Look up your course in the search bar and see basic info at a glance and save yourself a headache :)<br /><br />
                    If you're interested, you can look up the source code <a href="https://github.com/fadilf/course-history/" target="_blank">here</a> to view the dataset and make something awesome!<br /><br />
